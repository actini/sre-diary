## Simplicity

* Always ask
  * Are there any simpler solution / design?
  * Are there anything not necessary in the picture?
  * Are there anything we can work on later (in a year or when needed)?
  * Are there anything we can do to simplify the process?
  * Are there anything we can do to reduce operation steps?
  * Are there anything we can do to reduce user inputs?

## Operation

* Work for the best, prepare for the worst
* Always operate with validations
  * Test cases
  * Check lists
